#Corpus: A Textual Corpus Downloader for Digital Humanities

Corpus is a command-line textual corpus downloader, designed for use in the Digital Humanities. This program is useful for anyone that needs to download large amounts of text, say, for text analysis. Want to conduct a digital macroanalysis of all Shakespeare plays? How about a linguistic study of a news corpus? This tool helps you get those texts, so you spend less time online and more time with the analysis itself. 

Corpus handles downloading corpora from a few different protocols and file types. It does the equivalent of `git clone` (with recursive submodule checkout, as well) and `wget`, but also unzips and untars archives, simplifying the process of getting a corpus.

## Demo

## Available Functions and Options

From `corpus --help`: 

```

Usage: corpus.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Corpus is a command line tool that lists and downloads textual corpora.

  This tool was originally created for use in the Digital Humanities toolbox
  called DHBox.

Options:
  --verbose  Get extra information about what's happening behind the scenes.
  --debug    Turn on debugging messages.
  --version  Show the version and exit.
  --help     Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  download  Downloads a corpus.
  list      Lists corpora available for download.
```


## Configuring

Corpus reads a config file from config.yaml, which should be in the same directory as corpus.py. It has these configurable items: 

```
corpuslist: corpus-list/corpus-list.yaml   
downloadTo: ~/corpora
```

`corpuslist` is a path to the corpus catalog. You can add your own corpora here if you follow the YAML format of the existing entries. 

`downloadTo` is the destination location on your local machine, where the corpora will be downloaded.  

## Installing

Until this package shows up on Pypi, you can change into this programâ€™s directory and run `pip3 install .`. (Make sure you have pip3, the python package manager for Python 3 installed first.)
